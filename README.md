 # ImageManager

 ## Introduction
 The ImageManager lets you display a list of images(maximum 15) whose order you can adapt by either removing and adding the images in the desired order, or by dragging and dropping them into the desired location.
 By clicking on an image loaded into the ImageManager, the preview button on the left will automatically show the selected image.
 By clicking on the preview button the image will then be displayed in a separate preview window(full screen).
